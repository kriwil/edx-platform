***********************
HTML Component Overview
***********************

HTML components are the basic building blocks of your course content. You use HTML components to add and format text, links, images, and more. 

For more information, see the following topics:

* :ref:`The HTML Editor`
* :ref:`Create an HTML Component`
* :ref:`Add a Link in an HTML Component`
* :ref:`Add an Image to an HTML Component`
* :ref:`Import LaTeX Code`

.. note:: Review :ref:`Organizing Your Course Content` and :ref:`Best Practices for HTML Markup` before you start working with HTML components.

To add an instant hangout to an HTML component, see :ref:`Using an Instant Hangout in Your Course`.

.. _The HTML Editor:

*****************************************
The HTML Component Editor
*****************************************

When you create a new HTML component, you work with the HTML editor:

.. image:: ../Images/HTMLEditor.png
 :alt: Image of the HTML component editor

The editor provides a “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) interface that allows you to format text by clicking the formatting buttons at the top of the editor. 

.. note:: The editor attempts to ensure the underlying HTML code is valid; for example, if you do not close a div tag, it inserts one at the end of the paragraph. You can see this by opening the HTML code editor, as described below.

The following image shows call-outs for the editing options and is followed by descriptions.

#. Choose a formatting style for the selected paragraph, such as heading 1, heading 2, or paragraph.
#. Choose a font family for selected text, such as Arial, Courier New, or Times New Roman.
#. Format selected text in bold.
#. Format selected text in italics.
#. Underline selected text.
#. Apply a color to the selected text.
#. Format selected text as code.
#. Create a bulleted list.
#. Create a numbered list.
#. Decrease and increased the indentation of the selected paragraph.
#. Format the selected paragraph as a blockquote.
#. Create a link from the selected text. See :ref:`Add a Link in an HTML Component`.
#. Delete the current link.
#. Insert an image at the cursor. See :ref:`Add an Image to an HTML Component`.
#. Work with HTML source code, described below.


.. _Work with HTML code:

============================
Work with HTML code
============================

To work with HTML source code for the component, click **HTML**  in the editor toolbar. The HTML source code editor opens:

.. image:: ../Images/HTML_source_code.png
 :alt: Image of the HTML source code editor

Edit the HTML code as needed.  

Click **OK** to apply your changes to the HTML editor and close the source code.

.. warning:: Clicking **OK** in the source code editor does not save your changes to the HTML component.  You return to the component editor, where your changes are applied.  You must click **Save** to save your changes and close the component. If you click **Cancel**, the changes you made in the HTML source code are lost.


.. _Create an HTML Component:

*****************************

#. Save the HTML component and test the link.

.. _Add an Image to an HTML Component:

***********************************
Add an Image to an HTML Component
***********************************

You can add any image that you have uploaded for the course to an HTML component. For more information about uploading images, see :ref:`Add Files to a Course`.

.. note:: Review :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images` before you add images to HTML components.

To add an image, you'll need the URL of the image that you uploaded to the course. You'll then create a link to the image in the HTML component.

#. On the **Files & Uploads** page, copy the **Embed URL** of the image that you want.

  .. image:: ../Images/image_link.png
   :alt: Image of the Files & Upload page with the Embed URL for the image circled

  .. note:: You must use the **Embed URL** to add the image, not the **External URL**.

2. Click the image icon in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert image** dialog box, enter the following in the **Source** field.

   ``/static/FileName.type``

   Make sure to include both forward slashes (/).

   .. image:: ../Images/HTML_Insert-Edit_Image.png
    :alt: Image of the Insert image dialog box with a reference to a file

4. Enter alternative text in the **Image description** field. This text becomes the value of the ``alt`` attribute in HTML and is required for your course to be fully accessible. See :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images` for more information.

#. As needed, customize the image dimensions. Keep **Constrain proportions** checked to ensure the image keeps the same width and height proportions.

#. To change the spacing and border of the image, click the **Advanced** tab. 

   .. image:: ../Images/HTML_Insert-Edit_Image_Advanced.png
    :alt: Image of the Insert image dialog box Advanced tab

#. Enter the **Vertical space**, **Horizontal space**, and **Border** as needed. The values you enter are automatically added to the **Style** field.

#. Click **OK** to insert the image in the HTML component.

#. Save the HTML component and test the image.


.. _Import LaTeX Code:

****************************************
Import LaTeX Code into an HTML Component
****************************************

You can import LaTeX code into an HTML component. You might do this, for example, if you want to create "beautiful math" such as the following.

.. image:: ../Images/HTML_LaTeX_LMS.png
 :alt: Image of math formulas created with LaTeX

.. warning:: The LaTeX processor that Studio uses to convert LaTeX code to XML is a third-party tool. We recommend that you use this feature with caution. If you do use it, make sure to work with your PM.

This feature is not enabled by default. To enable it, you have to change the advanced settings in your course. 

To create an HTML component that contains LaTeX code:

#. Enable the policy key in your course.

   #. In Studio, click **Settings**, and then click **Advanced Settings**.
   #. On the **Advanced Settings** page, scroll down to the **use_latex_compiler** policy key.
   #. In the **Policy Value** field next to the **use_latex_compiler** policy key, change **false** to **true**.
   #. At the bottom of the page, click **Save Changes**.

#. In the unit where you want to create the component, click **html** under **Add New Component**, and then click **E-text Written in LaTeX**. The new component is added to the unit.

#. Click **Edit** to open the new component. The component editor opens.

  .. image:: ../Images/latex_component.png
   :alt: Image of the HTML component editor with the Latex compiler.

4. In the component editor, click **Launch Latex Source Compiler**. The Latex editor opens.

   .. image:: ../Images/HTML_LaTeXEditor.png
    :alt: Image of the HTML component editor with the Latex compiler.

#. Write Latex code as needed. You can also upload a Latex file into the editor from your computer by clicking **Upload** in the bottom right corner.

#. When you have written or uploaded the Latex code you need, click **Save & Compile to edX XML** in the lower-left corner.

   The component editor closes. You can see the way your LaTeX content looks.

   .. image:: ../Images/HTML_LaTeX_CompEditor.png
    :alt: Image of the LaTeX component

#. On the unit page, click **Preview** to verify that your content looks the way you want it to in the LMS. 

   If you see errors, go back to the unit page. Click **Edit** to open the component again, and then click **Launch Latex Source Compiler** in the lower-left corner of the component editor to edit the LaTeX code.
